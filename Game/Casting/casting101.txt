Documentation on the casting classes:

Actor: a thing that participates in the game
- debug: is it being debugged? (default is 0)


Point: stores an x value and a y value,
    which can be used for both points
    in 2D space and velocities
- Add(Point point): adds one point to another and returns the result
- AddValues(int x, int y): adds two values to the point and returns
            the result
- Scale(int scale, bool x, bool y): takes a scalar value and changes
            x, y, or both by the value. For example, Scale(2, 1, 0)
            will double the x but keep the y value the same.
- Reverse(): simply multiplies the x and y values by -1 to reflect them


Mario: the plumber himself
- body: associated class that stores postion, size, and so forth
- animation: associated class that stores Mario's animations
- isGrounded: checks if Mario is on the ground (and thus can jump)

- MoveNext(): gets Mario's postion and velocity, and adds them to get
            a new position
- StopMoving(): sets Mario's velocity to 0 in both directions
